# VR Jam Sample Projects
Here are the projects we made in the tutorial section of the VR Jam in case you want a starting point.

# A-Frame Tips
The A-Frame documentation is fantastic if you want to know anything about the framework, don't hesitate to take a look.

You may run into some snags getting it to work with an Oculus on a laptop though, so follow the tips from this website.

# Unity
The Unity docs in general are comprehensive but a little rough to navigate, and you will need two key sources to find what you need.

https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html

Unity is especially google-able so don't hesitate to direct your questions there, or to stack overflow.
